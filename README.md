# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++. The following files are included:

## File Descriptions
1. [Binary_Tree.cpp](Binary_Tree.cpp)
This file contains the implementation of a binary tree data structure. The binary tree includes various functions for insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and search operations.
### Features:
- Building Tree
- In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversals

2. [Merge_Sort.cpp](Merge_Sort.cpp)
This file implements the merge sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer sorting technique.
### Features:
- Splitting the array into sub-arrays
- Merging sorted sub-arrays
- Sorting in O(n log n) time complexity

3. [Quick_Sort.cpp](Quick_Sort.cpp)
This file contains the implementation of the quick sort algorithm, another efficient divide-and-conquer sorting method.
### Features:
- Partitioning the array
- Recursively sorting the partitions
- Sorting in average O(n log n) time complexity

4. [Stack_Queue_List.cpp](Stack_Queue_List.cpp)
This file includes the implementation of stack, queue, and list data structures.
### Features:
- Stack operations: push, pop, top, isEmpty
- Queue operations: enqueue, dequeue, front, isEmpty
- List operations: insertion, deletion, traversal

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

### Compilation
To compile any of the files, use the following command:
```bash
g++ -o output_filename source_file.cpp
```
For example, to compile `Binary_Tree.cpp`, use:
```bash
g++ -o Binary_Tree Binary_Tree.cpp
```

### Running the Executable
After compiling the code, run the executable with:
```bash
./output_filename
```
For example:
```bash
./Binary_Tree
```
